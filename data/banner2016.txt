The course begins by highlighting the intentional and unintentional exploitation of populations and communities during the course of global public health research and practice. We discuss existing ethical principles for research and professional conduct as well as regulations guiding ethical action. These principles and regulations provide a framework for interrogating and debating the protection of human subjects in public health research and practice, and introspection about our role as global health students, professionals, and advocates. We examine, using case studies, ethical quandaries and complexities that arise. The next portion of the course explores the challenge and promise of community-engaged research, practice, and learning. This portion of the course also explores strategies for finding and establishing meaningful collaborative relationships. Then we examine the challenges of ethical research and practice when working with potentially vulnerable populations. This includes conflicts that occur when ethical norms and guidelines differ across international settings and the complex ethical tensions that can arise when responding to pressing global public health challenges. Special attention is paid to methods for fostering ethical engagement. The final portion of the course provides an in-depth examination of historical, political, and economic forces that shape the context of global public health. This portion of the course also focuses upon roles and responsibilities after studies have completed, or after time in an international location has ended. We provide an overview of how to prepare for IRB. Throughout the course, students integrate what has been learned into a written syntheses that showcase how they plan to thoughtfully and meaningfully implement rigorous ethical approaches in their own global public health work. The course is intended for graduate students and advanced undergraduates. Preferably, students have taken an epidemiology course; having taken PHP 1070 â€œBurden of Disease in Developing Countriesâ€ or another relevant global health course would be helpful. Equivalent introductory-level courses in epidemiology and/or global health, taken at another department/institution with a grade of B or higher, can also satisfy these requirements.

What role did force play in ensuring popular allegiance to the regime? What role did the Church play? Did Fascism remake concepts of gender? Attention will be paid to the role of the media, writers, intellectuals, and the arts.

Although, the Russian literary angels are in many respects related to their Western counterparts, the apocalyptic character of Russian spiritual culture makes them in many respects unique. Examining these images, the course addresses the important questions concerning the human condition in general. Angels as one critic said, \"represent something that was ours and that we have the potential to become again\"; their essence is otherness. Consequently, their literary representations explore the possibilities of human existence as well as its central paradigms like, love, rebirth, mortality, or 'fallenness.'  The course will analyze the images of angels and fallen angels (devils) in the works of the nineteenth and the twentieth-century Russian prose, visual art, and film - from romanticism to 'postmodernism' - in the context of the world literature and culture. Authors to be studied: Byron, Lermontov, Balzac, Dostoevskii, Sologub, Bulgakov, Nabokov, Erofeev. We will also discuss films by Tarkovskii and Wenders, Russian icons, and paintings by Vrubel.
