# cs0320 Term Project

**Team Members:** 
Alberta Devor, Amy Winkler, Koko Nakajima, Nathaniel Parrott
(A very heterogrenous team of fun friends!!)

**Project Idea:** 
We are going to make a web application to help students navigate the stressful and tumultuous series of days that is known as “shopping period”. We are going to allow students to add courses to an easy to use mobile-responsive calendar. We will also suggest courses to fill empty time slots.

### Overview:
We are going to make a web application to help students navigate the stressful and tumultuous series of days that is known as “shopping period”. We are going to allow students to add courses to an easy to use mobile-responsive calendar. We will also suggest courses to fill empty time slots.
### Potential User Flow:
(First-time user)
 * Log in with my Brown account information
* Input preliminary information (concentration, departments I’m interested in, etc?)
* Calendar view
      * Ability to add multiple courses per timeslot
      * Ability to toggle course suggestions for specified timeslots

### Necessary Features:
1. brown.edu email authentication/Brown Wifi authentication:

      * We need this because the Critical Review data cannot be accessed outside of the Brown community. We will explore which method is the most reasonable out of these two. 

2. Calendar with time slots

      * Students often have multiple ways of keeping track of their shopping period courses because they are uncertain about how to keep all of their options (that they prioritize in different ways) in one list. Having an intuitive and easy to use calendar in our app would be essential for allowing students to create their shopping schedule in one application. In our preliminary interviews, students said they primarily used Courses@Brown’s calendar export functionality to keep track of where and when to shop (although some supplemented with written notes, suggesting that there’s room to improve on the calendar-based approach).

3. Integration with Critical Review data

      * Critical Review data can be used to generate relevant course recommendations based on factors like open timeslots on the user’s schedule, indicated department interests, and class year demographic. In our preliminary interviews we spoke with many students who thought the Critical Review was an invaluable resource for shopping period.

4. Integration with Banner Data

      *  We must use banner data to get information about all of the courses that brown offers for a given semester, their descriptions, time slots and locations.

5. Using data to suggest course for open timeslots

      *  We will develop a ranking system to generate suggested courses for students based on the courses in their cart, their department preferences, and their open times. Interviewed participants indicated that they lacked a concrete system for getting suggestions outside of their own department. Participants also indicated they specifically were unsure how to obtain suggestions in departments where they do not have friends who have already taken courses in the department. This would benefit students who are looking for suggestions in departments where they do not have social connections.

###Potential Features:

* Exporting a calendar to Google Calendar, iCal formats
* See courses your friends are shopping
* Course recommendations based on Critical Review’s “Respondents also recommended…”. The only reason this is a potential feature is because we are still in preliminary talks about getting the actual review text from the critical review.
* Integrating data about number of students currently enrolled in the class

###Questions We Asked Potential Users:

Do you have a strategy for shopping classes? If so, what is it? Has it worked so far?

How many classes do you shop in a semester?

How do you keep track of the courses you’re shopping?

How do you prioritize courses with prioritizing timeslots?

What factors do you take into consideration when shopping classes?

Describe your shopping period experiences

Shopping period grievances
